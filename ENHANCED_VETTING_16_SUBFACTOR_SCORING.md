## Scoring Methodology

### Individual Sub-Factor Scoring (0-10 scale)
- 0-2: Poor - Significant deficiencies
- 3-4: Below Average - Major improvements needed
- 5-6: Average - Some improvements needed
- 7-8: Good - Minor improvements needed
- 9-10: Excellent - Best in class

### Weighted Category Score Calculation
Category Score = Σ(Sub-Factor Score × Weight)

### Overall Vetting Score Calculation
Overall Score = (Market Score + Competition Score + SVE Alignment Score + Execution Score) / 4

### Weighted Overall Score Calculation
Weighted Score = Σ(Category Score × Category Weight)

## Decision Thresholds

### HIGH_PRIORITY (85-100)
Exceptional opportunities with strong alignment across all factors

### APPROVED (70-84)
Strong opportunities with minor improvements needed

### CONDITIONAL (55-69)
Viable opportunities requiring significant improvements

### NEEDS_REVISION (40-54)
Potential opportunities requiring major revisions

### REJECTED (0-39)
Insufficient opportunities requiring fundamental changes

## Confidence Level Calculation

The confidence level is calculated based on the average confidence of all sub-factors:
Confidence Level = Σ(Sub-Factor Confidence) / Total Sub-Factors

This provides a measure of the reliability of the scoring based on evidence quality, data availability, and assessment certainty.
