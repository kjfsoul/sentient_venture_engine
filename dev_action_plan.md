# SVE Enhancement Action Plan

This document outlines specific tasks and microtasks to address the identified opportunities and challenges in the Sentient Venture Engine (SVE) project, drawing from sections 4.1-4.5 and 5.1 of the evaluation.

## 1. Opportunities for Improvement (from Section 4)

### 1.1. Granularity and Specificity in Key Mechanisms

#### Opportunity: Define the analytical framework for the causal analysis agent.
*   **Task:** Implement Causal Inference Logic using Python libraries.
    *   **Microtask:** Research and select appropriate causal inference libraries (e.g., `DoWhy`, `EconML`, `causal-learn`).
    *   **Microtask:** Define the initial causal graph (DAG) based on domain knowledge, representing relationships between hypothesis attributes, validation strategies, and outcomes.
    *   **Microtask:** Develop Python scripts to apply selected causal inference methods to historical `validation_results` and `human_feedback` data from Supabase.
    *   **Microtask:** Store identified causal factors, their strengths, and actionable recommendations in the `causal_insights` table in Supabase.

#### Opportunity: Develop a dynamic, data-driven system for setting and adjusting validation thresholds.
*   **Task:** Implement an RL-based Threshold Adjustment Script.
    *   **Microtask:** Select a suitable RL framework (e.g., `Stable Baselines3`, `RLlib`).
    *   **Microtask:** Define the state representation for the RL agent (e.g., hypothesis attributes like market size, novelty score, initial sentiment).
    *   **Microtask:** Define the action space for the RL agent (e.g., continuous range for sentiment score thresholds, discrete set of conversion rate targets).
    *   **Microtask:** Design the reward signal based on the final "first dollar" outcome and resources consumed during validation.
    *   **Microtask:** Train the RL agent using historical `validation_results` and `causal_insights` data from Supabase.
    *   **Microtask:** Implement a mechanism for the RL script to periodically update optimal thresholds in a configuration file or dedicated Supabase table.
*   **Task:** Integrate dynamically adjusted thresholds into Validation Agents.
    *   **Microtask:** Modify validation agents to read and apply the latest optimal thresholds before making tier progression decisions.

#### Opportunity: Incorporate a more explicit definition of "high-potential" based on predefined market criteria, user preferences, or a separate "vetting" agent.
*   **Task:** Develop a "Vetting" Agent for initial hypothesis scoring.
    *   **Microtask:** Define a rubric or set of criteria for "high-potential" hypotheses (e.g., market size, competitive landscape, alignment with SVE goals).
    *   **Microtask:** Develop a `crewai` agent (`VettingAgent`) that scores initial ideas against this rubric.
    *   **Microtask:** Integrate the `VettingAgent` into the synthesis workflow, ensuring ideas are vetted before entering the validation gauntlet.

### 1.2. Data Ingestion and Oracle Enhancement

*   **Task:** Implement Real-time Data Ingestion with Redis.
    *   **Microtask:** Install and run a Redis server.
    *   **Microtask:** Develop `redis_publisher.py` for external data sources to publish events to Redis channels.

    *   **Microtask:** Adapt `redis_consumer.py` to integrate with Supabase client and define schema for real-time data.

### 1.3. Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) Interface and Interaction

#### Opportunity: Design a highly interactive and informative dashboard that visualizes key metrics, presents clear decision points, and allows for easy input of human judgments.
*   **Task:** Develop Frontend for HOTL Dashboard (React/TypeScript).
    *   **Microtask:** Initialize a React project using `manus-create-react-app`.
    *   **Microtask:** Connect the frontend to Supabase for real-time updates on SVE progress, validation status, and new hypotheses.
    *   **Microtask:** Implement data visualization using libraries like D3.js, Chart.js, or Recharts for KPIs, causal graphs, and validation funnels.

    *   **Microtask:** Use `service_deploy_frontend` to deploy the built dashboard.

#### Opportunity: Establish clear guidelines for human intervention, including how human decisions are recorded, analyzed, and incorporated into the SVE's memory and learning algorithms.
*   **Task:** Implement a "Human Feedback" Loop.
    *   **Microtask:** Ensure human decisions (approval/rejection) and their rationale are recorded in Supabase.
    *   **Microtask:** Develop a mechanism to analyze human feedback, potentially training a meta-learning model to understand when and why human intervention is necessary.
    *   **Microtask:** Integrate human feedback data into the causal analysis feedback loop to refine the SVE's learning.

### 1.4. Technical Implementation Details and Best Practices

#### Opportunity: Implement robust error logging, alerting, and retry mechanisms across all components.
*   **Task:** Implement Comprehensive Error Handling.

*   **Task:** Implement Security Best Practices.
    *   **Microtask:** Utilize environment variables and secure secrets management for API keys (e.g., `.env` file, or a dedicated secrets manager).
    *   **Microtask:** Ensure data encryption at rest (Supabase handles this) and in transit (HTTPS for all API calls).

    *   **Microtask:** Utilize MLflow Model Registry or W&B Artifacts for versioning and managing AI models.
    *   **Microtask:** Establish CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated retraining, evaluation, and deployment of new model versions.

### 1.5. Monetization and Deployment Strategy (Beyond TTFD)

#### Opportunity: Define specific "first dollar" pathways and tailor validation tiers to those pathways.
*   **Task:** Refine Validation Tiers based on "First Dollar" Pathways.
    *   **Microtask:** Clearly define the target "first dollar" pathways (e.g., SaaS subscriptions, product sales, licensing).
    *   **Microtask:** Adjust the metrics and success criteria for each validation tier to align with the chosen pathways (e.g., for SaaS, focus on early user sign-ups and engagement in Tier 3).

## 2. Challenges to Address (from Section 5.1)

### Challenge: The current blueprint lacks specificity on how the causal analysis agent will determine *why* ideas succeed or fail, and how this will inform future ideation.

*   **Task:** Implement Advanced Causal Inference Libraries.
    *   **Microtask:** Integrate Python libraries like `DoWhy` and `EconML` to perform robust causal inference on SVE data.
    *   **Microtask:** Develop scripts to model causal relationships, identify causal effects, and perform counterfactual analysis based on hypothesis attributes, validation strategies, and outcomes.
    *   **Microtask:** Use LLMs (Gemini Advanced, ChatGPT Plus, Qwen 3) to interpret causal analysis results and generate human-understandable insights and actionable recommendations for the synthesis crew.

This action plan provides a structured approach to addressing the identified opportunities and challenges, ensuring the continuous enhancement and optimization of the Sentient Venture Engine. Each task and microtask is designed to be actionable, with clear indications of tool usage and user responsibilities.
