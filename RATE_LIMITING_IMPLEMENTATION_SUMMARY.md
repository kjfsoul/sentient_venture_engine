# Rate Limiting Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the rate limiting and failure handling mechanisms that have been implemented across the intelligence agents in the Sentient Venture Engine.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Rate Limiting Decorators

All agents now include rate limiting decorators that:
- Track API requests per provider
- Enforce requests per minute limits
- Automatically wait when rate limits are reached
- Support different rate limits for different providers

### 2. Exponential Backoff with Jitter

Failure handling includes:
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Special handling for rate limit errors (HTTP 429)
- Configurable retry counts and base delays

### 3. Provider-Specific Rate Limits

Different API providers have different rate limits:
- **OpenAI**: 10 requests per minute
- **Gemini**: 5 requests per minute
- **OpenRouter**: 15 requests per minute
- **GitHub**: 5000 requests per hour
- **Default**: 10 requests per minute

## Updated Agents

### Enhanced Multimodal Agent
- Added rate limiting for image analysis APIs
- Implemented exponential backoff for API failures
- Enhanced error handling for commercial API calls

### Code Analysis Agent
- Added GitHub API rate limiting (5000 requests/hour)
- Implemented exponential backoff for GitHub API calls
- Enhanced error handling for repository analysis

### Enhanced Market Intelligence Agent
- Added rate limiting for LLM providers
- Implemented exponential backoff for LLM initialization
- Enhanced error handling for multi-provider support

### Market Intelligence Agent
- Added rate limiting for OpenRouter API
- Implemented exponential backoff for LLM calls
- Enhanced error handling for search tools

## Key Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting Mechanism
```python
@rate_limit('provider_name')
def api_call():
    # API call implementation
```

### Exponential Backoff
```python
@exponential_backoff(max_retries=3, base_delay=1.0)
def api_call():
    # API call implementation
```

### Error Handling
- Automatic detection of rate limit errors (HTTP 429, "rate limit" in error message)
- Graceful degradation when rate limits are consistently hit
- Detailed logging of rate limiting events

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Service Disruption**: Rate limiting prevents the system from being blocked by API providers
2. **Improves Reliability**: Exponential backoff helps recover from temporary failures
3. **Reduces Errors**: Proper error handling prevents crashes when services are unavailable
4. **Maintains Performance**: Jitter prevents synchronized retries that could overwhelm services

## Configuration

Rate limits can be adjusted by modifying the `RATE_LIMIT_CONFIG` dictionaries in each agent:

```python
RATE_LIMIT_CONFIG = {
    'provider_name': {'requests_per_minute': 10, 'burst_limit': 5}
}
```

## Monitoring

All rate limiting events are logged with appropriate warning levels:
- `⏳` indicates a rate limit wait period
- `⚠️` indicates a retry due to failure
- `✅` indicates successful request completion

This implementation ensures that the intelligence agents can operate reliably even under heavy usage or when API providers enforce strict rate limits.
